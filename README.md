In this project, itâ€™s provided a dataset (CSV file) of house sale prices for King County, including Seattle, over an one year period from May 2014 to May 2015.

## Main Task <br /> 
Develop a machine learning model to predict the house sale prices

## Approach <br /> 
Doing several notebooks with slightly differences between them and checking the results <br /> In the end I will only present the final results and the last notebook

# Conclusions ðŸ’­

- Less data doesn't mean a more accurate model
- Accuracy results doesn't change too much with the data cleaning and featuring engineering
- XGBoost got the best results suggesting a non linear relationship between features and target
