# Project Overview 💻

## Context <br /> 
In this project, it’s provided a dataset (CSV file) of house sale prices for King County, including Seattle, over an one year period from May 2014 to May 2015. <br /> Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minasameh55/king-country-houses-aa

## Main Task <br /> 
Develop a machine learning model to predict the house sale prices

## Approach <br /> 
Doing several notebooks with slightly differences between them and checking the results <br /> In the end I will only present the final results and the last notebook

# Exploring the data 🔍

| Function | Output |
| :---: | :---: |
| .shape | 21613 rows and 21 columns |
| .dtypes | 1 categorical column (date), 20 numerical columns (5 as float) |
| .isnull().sum() | 0 null values |
| .eq(" ").sum() | 0 empty spaces |
| .multiplicated().sum() | 0 multiplicate values |

# Results 💥

# Conclusions 💭

- Less data doesn't mean a more accurate model
- Accuracy results doesn't change too much with the data cleaning and featuring engineering
- XGBoost got the best results suggesting a non linear relationship between features and target
